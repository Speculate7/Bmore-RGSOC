####**Self-motivation Strategies**
Self-motivation is a holistic attempt to encourage oneself to continue progreesing. 
We have created a plan thath encorporates both of our extra curricular pursuits, favorite things, and 
spirit. When one of us feels down, we know what the other need to feel motivated, whether that be a
favorite health juice. When we both feel down we might need the help of others to help us get back on our feet again.
We are comforatble sharing our feelings with our comminuty who will be ther to support us.
