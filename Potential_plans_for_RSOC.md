##Project Proposal

For almost a year, Ashley and I have steadily developed our proficency of ruby on rails. When a friend of
ours shared this opportunity with us were thrilled. We would be able to take our skills to the next level
and have projects to show the fruits of our labor. We come from a community that fosters giving

      <p>Ore Akins is a staunch advocate of increasing the visibility  
      of women in the technology sector. While studyingâ€‹ chemical  
      engineering at Howard University, Ore became increasingly aware  
      of how few people in the tech world looked like her. This inspired   
      her to begin advocating on behalf of other women, and women of color   
      in the tech sector. Through her work with Women Who Code DC and the  
      Baltimore Women in Tech community, Ore has       proven her commitment   
      to making the tech sector more inclusive. As a teacher   
      for Code in the Schools, Ore provides quality computer science instruction   
      to under-served and under-represented youth in Baltimore City. Ore has   
      jumped in feet first and has become an integral part of the CITS team.   
      She is now mentoring students in our Prodigy Program, imparting invaluable   
      developer knowledge upon them, and preparing them for bright futures. This   
      spring Ore will be launching a Black Girls Code Baltimore City chapter and   
      plans to get young women from her neighborhood engaged in coding events this summer.

####**Self-motivation Strategies**
Self-motivation is a holistic attempt to encourage oneself to continue progreesing. 
We have created a plan thath encorporates both of our extra curricular pursuits, favorite things, and 
spirit. When one of us feels down, we know what the other need to feel motivated, whether that be a
favorite health juice. When we both feel down we might need the help of others to help us get back on our feet again.
We are comforatble sharing our feelings with our comminuty who will be ther to support us.
